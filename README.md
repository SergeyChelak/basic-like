# Basic-like interpreter/programming language

## Rust version of [jasic](https://github.com/munificent/jasic)

Consider this project as Hello World in the interpreters/compiler development

Like an original implementation, this one have similar problems/issues
- missing error handling during parsing/tokenizing
- ~~period is not supported in the double values~~
- arithmetical operations are interpreted in wrong order (just left to right, no operation priorities)
- FOR loop is missing

This project has no purpose to became a ready-to-use programming language. That's why I plan to fix existing issues and extend functionality according to my own knowledge of this development area and also take into account my time availability for this project
